## Random Module 

Randome module allows you to access function that support many operation such like generating random numbers. We use it when we want from the computer to pick a random number for a specific task like to generate a random number to complete a list of data , or to pick a random card from a deck etc. 

## Random functions
* Randint a function that generates a random integer between two parameters : a lowest and a highst number. The first value should be less than the seconed 

* Random: if we want a larger number we can multiply it using the random function

* Choice: generate a random value from a sequence of values or list of values

* Shuffle: Shuffles the elements in place in random order.

* Randrange: generate a randomly selected element form range(start,stop,step)


## Risk Analysis

### Why Risk Analysis
  In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. 
  
  The possible risks that you could encounter 
    * Use of new hardware
    * Use of new technology
    * Use of new automation tool
    * The sequence of code
    * Availability of test resources for the application
    
### Risk Identification
There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process. Those are as follows:

Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.


### The perspective of Risk Assessment
There are three perspectives of Risk Assessment:

Effect

Cause

Likelihood

Effect – To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.

Cause – To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.

Likelihood – To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied.

Now, heading forward, the question that would be hovering over your mind is, how actually shall we perform risk analysis? Well, here is your solution!

### How to perform Risk Analysis?
There are three steps:

Searching the risk

Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

Measures for the risk identified
