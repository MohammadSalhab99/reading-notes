# The Growth Mindset 
Carol Dweck, a Stanford University psychologist, analyzes the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. People with a fixed mindset “care so much about how smart they will appear that they often reject learning opportunities” (Dweck 2) instead of wanting to achieve their full potential.
Other people, the ones with a growth mindset, seek for higher achievements in learning, wanting to develop their knowledge capacity. It’s either they give up on their selves or learn from their setbacks and try again. A person with a fixed mindset believes that they are born with talent while a person with
a growth mindset believes that ability can be further developed. 

I agree with professor Dweck about the growth mindset, I think we should all have the this mind set to develop in our careers and life .
