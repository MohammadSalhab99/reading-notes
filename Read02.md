## TDD with python
TDD stands for Test-Driven Development
Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

### The Cycle
I hope at this time you didn‚Äôt give up of this text because this is an example of an important thing about TDD: the cycle.
The cycle is made by three steps:
üÜò Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn‚Äôt there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
‚úÖ Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
üîµ Refactor the code ‚Äî the first version doesn‚Äôt need to be the beautiful one (don‚Äôt be shy)
Using baby steps you can go through this cycle every time you add or modify a new feature in your code.
And talking about feature‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs do the cycle!
We made our test fail. Awesome! Now it‚Äôs time to implement the feature. Thinking with baby steps, our implementation should follow the same rule, ok? So, what is needed to make this test pass? Don‚Äôt think about the whole feature, just about the test.

#### TDD is not about the money/tests
More than any checking, we need to think about our software design first.
One of the things that amaze me about TDD is how we can grow our software design consciously and well, just building what is needed to make the test pass. When we are writing tests we are forced to think about the design first and how we can break it into small pieces.

#### I hope this was fun for you! To remember:
- The greatest advantage about TDD is to craft the software design first
- Your code will be more reliable: after a change you can run your tests and be in peace
- Beginning may be hard ‚Äî and that‚Äôs fine. You just need to practice!

## What does the if __name__ == ‚Äú__main__‚Äù: do?

efore executing code, Python interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables. 
If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value ‚Äú__main__‚Äù. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module‚Äôs name. Module‚Äôs name is available as value to __name__ global variable. 

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. 

### Advantages : 

1. Every Python module has it‚Äôs __name__ defined and if this is ‚Äò__main__‚Äô, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.
2. If you import this script as a module in another script, the __name__ is set to the name of the script/module.
3. Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.
4. if __name__ == ‚Äúmain‚Äù: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.

## Recursion
What is Recursion? 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function
is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such
problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.
A Mathematical Interpretation

Let us consider a problem that a programmer have to determine the sum of first n natural numbers, there are several ways of doing that but the simplest approach is simply add the numbers starting from 1 to n. So the function simply looks like,

approach(1) ‚Äì Simply adding one by one

f(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 +‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..+ n

but there is another mathematical approach of representing this,

approach(2) ‚Äì Recursive adding 

f(n) = 1                  n=1

f(n) = n + f(n-1)    n>1

There is a simple difference between the approach (1) and approach(2) and that is in approach(2) the function ‚Äú f( ) ‚Äù itself is being called inside the function, so this phenomenon is named as recursion and the function containing recursion is called recursive function, at the end this is a great tool in the hand of the programmers to code some problems in a lot easier and efficient way.

What is base condition in recursion? 
In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems. 
 

int fact(int n)
{
    if (n < = 1) // base case
        return 1;
    else    
        return n*fact(n-1);    
}
In the above example, base case for n < = 1 is defined and larger value of number can be solved by converting to smaller one till base case is reached.

How a particular problem is solved using recursion? 
The idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems, and add one or more base conditions that stop the recursion. For example, we compute factorial n if we know factorial of (n-1). The base case for factorial would be n = 0. We return 1 when n = 0. 

Why Stack Overflow error occurs in recursion? 
If the base case is not reached or not defined, then the stack overflow problem may arise. Let us take an example to understand this.

int fact(int n)
{
    // wrong base case (it may cause
    // stack overflow).
    if (n == 100) 
        return 1;

    else
        return n*fact(n-1);
}
If fact(10) is called, it will call fact(9), fact(8), fact(7) and so on but the number will never reach 100. So, the base case is not reached. If the memory is exhausted by these functions on the stack, it will cause a stack overflow error. 

What is the difference between direct and indirect recursion? 
A function fun is called direct recursive if it calls the same function fun. A function fun is called indirect recursive if it calls another function say fun_new and fun_new calls fun directly or indirectly. Difference between direct and indirect recursion has been illustrated in Table 1. 

// An example of direct recursion
void directRecFun()
{
    // Some code....

    directRecFun();

    // Some code...
}

// An example of indirect recursion
void indirectRecFun1()
{
    // Some code...

    indirectRecFun2();

    // Some code...
}
void indirectRecFun2()
{
    // Some code...

    indirectRecFun1();

    // Some code...
}
What is difference between tailed and non-tailed recursion? 
A recursive function is tail recursive when recursive call is the last thing executed by the function. Please refer tail recursion article for details. 

How memory is allocated to different function calls in recursion? 
When any function is called from main(), the memory is allocated to it on the stack. A recursive function calls itself, the memory for a called function
is allocated on top of memory allocated to calling function and different copy of local variables is created for each function call. When the base case is 
reached, the function returns its value to the function by whom it is called and memory is de-allocated and the process continues.
