## Pain vs Suffering
I believe that there should be pain to achieve goals and I am sure that this course will help to achieve my goals more than the 4 years that I spent in the university. No pain no gain

## Big O notation
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

* O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
* O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
* O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
* O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential — starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically.

## Names and values in python 
This video explains the unclear things when using python

 Assignments
 The difference between rebinding and mutating 
 Dynamic typing (Any name -> any value @ any time)
 ### intresting qoutes 
  Assignments never copies data 
  Python is neither "call by value" nor "call by reference" it's call by assignment 
  There is no way in python where the name can refer to another name. A name can only refer to values.
